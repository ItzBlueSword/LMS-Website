# 📚 LMS Website

## ***Because learning should be easier than debugging.***

## 🚀 Overview
This is my LMS (Learning Management System) website built with React + Vite.
I made it to practice web development, learn new tools, and suffer slightly less every time I run `npm install`.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Search bar — so users can find courses faster than I find my missing semicolon.
- 📚 Course pages — neat and organised (unlike my desktop).
- 👤 Student sections — clean layout for easy navigation.
- 📱 Responsive design — works on all devices, even that old phone hiding in your drawer.
- ⚡ Built with React, Vite, TailwindCSS — a combo so fast it makes instant noodles jealous.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 40% caffeine, 60% "please work"

## 🎯 Purpose
I created this project to level up my coding skills and understand how real websites are built.
Every update = one step closer to becoming a professional developer (and one step further from tutorial dependency).
